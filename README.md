# task-4
Overview

This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing an e-commerce dataset as part of the Data Analyst Internship Task 3. The task was completed using MySQL via the command line.

Files





task3.sql: SQL script with queries to create tables, insert sample data, and perform analysis (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, JOINS, subqueries, aggregates, views, and indexes).



query1_output.png: Output of SELECT query with WHERE and ORDER BY for orders in June 2025.



query2_output.png: Output of JOIN queries (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) combining customers and orders.



query3_output.png: Output of subquery identifying customers with above-average order amounts.



query4_output.png: Output of aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) for orders by city.



query5_output.png: Output of the order_summary view combining order, customer, and product data.



query6_output.png: Output of EXPLAIN for query optimization with indexes.

Approach





Database Setup: Created an ecommerce database with tables: customers, orders, products, and order_details.



Data Population: Inserted sample data to simulate an e-commerce scenario.



Query Writing: Developed SQL queries to meet task requirements:





Used SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY to filter and sort orders.



Applied INNER, LEFT, and RIGHT JOINS to combine tables.



Wrote a subquery to find above-average orders.



Used aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) for city-wise analysis.



Created a view for simplified order details.



Optimized queries with indexes and analyzed with EXPLAIN.



Execution: Ran queries via MySQL command line and captured screenshots of results.



Submission: Uploaded all files to this GitHub repository.
